# Hydro Snowflake Whitepaper
Snowflake is an Identity Protocol. We believe that by creating a modular, open framework in the decentralized identity space, we will help individuals craft their digital identities and enable projects of all flavors and varieties to easily and securely access this data in a decentralized manner.

[This whitepaper](./Snowflake_DRAFT.md) is currently a *DRAFT*, i.e. aspects of it are likely to change. We would love for community members to suggest ideas, offer insights, or even fix typos.
