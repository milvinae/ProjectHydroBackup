# Talha’s Background:

_“Since the beginning of the Hydro project, I have been voluntarily managing the Hydro Community in Turkey. As a result, I’ve been very involved with all the social media accounts and translations of the Hydro white papers and articles. Beside that, I am a Research Assistant at Dokuz Eylul University Fine Arts Faculty and I’m currently pursuing my PHD studies at Film Design Department.” _

# Talha’s Vision for Hydro:

_“I believe with the Hydro app and APIs (or with many other dApps), individuals should have the access not only to financial services but also to the other services/data on the Public Blockchain. Therefore, I’m aiming to announce Project Hydro more in Turkey (surely also in the world). For this matter, contacting individuals, companies, institutions and also techno villages which include many start-up companies, organizing events and enlarging the operations of social media accounts are the most essential duties to involve the others into this ecosystem.”_
