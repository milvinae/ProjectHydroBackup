# Saurav’s Background:

_“I’ve been involved in Blockchain and Cryptocurrency for the past two years, during which time I have done work for/with many startups. I first heard about Hydrogen in February, and the moment I saw the introduction video of what Hydrogen wants to do and what they want to achieve, I became an admirer of the team and the project. I was promoted to administrator of the Project Hydro group in April. From then on I have worked as a volunteer helping out the fellow community members._

_I am a dedicated, organized & methodical individual. I have good interpersonal skills, am an excellent team worker, and I am very willing to learn and develop new skills. I also have a creative mind and I am always up for new challenges."_

# Saurav’s Vision for Hydro:

_“I believe Hydro deserves to be one of the top ten blockchain projects and I will do everything that I can for Hydro to achieve this. I will help bring new developers to the platform by spreading the word about hydro in social media and crypto related forums, as well using my connections to get more platforms to integrate Hydro products."_
