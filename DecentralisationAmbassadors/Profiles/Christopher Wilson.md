# Christopher’s Background:

*“I have spent the last 20 years connecting with people working in Business Development, Consulting and Partnerships. When I was introduced to the crypto space a couple years ago the concepts being thrown around were both revolutionary and intriguing, and as we move forward as a community we can continue to let these concepts mature. When I was first introduced to Hydro, I saw a forward thinking team, a rock solid community, and ahead of the curve thinking. I am humbled to be a part of it.”*  

# Christopher’s Vision for Hydro:

*“I want to answer this in two ways. First off, I think that any blockchain based project should be striving for mass adoption first and foremost. One of the things that makes Hydro so strong is the ability to function on many levels with the other parts of the ecosystem. This is a broader vision.* 

*On a more singular scale I look forward to represnting Hydro at a number of upcoming conferences and events, as well as hosting local meetups for my local crypto community. I also will be hosting a number of social media campaigns over the next 6 month period to raise awareness and drive partnerships. ”*
