# Joel’s Background:

*“I have been a member of the Hydro community since February and, under the name Milvus*, have taken an active role in helping the community learn more about the project. I was the creator of the Hydro Community GitHub, as well as the associated Hydro Community Twitter and Medium accounts. I also moderate the Hydro Telegram, Discord, and Reddit accounts. Outside of Hydro I am a geologist with over 15 years experience in business and local government roles.”*

# Joel’s Vision for Hydro:

*“I have long been an advocate of people being able to ‘own’ and secure their data, taking control away from huge, centralised, monopolies, and I believe that the Hydro project will help realise this ideal within the financial sector. As a DA I will continue to grow the Hydro Community, acting as a bridge between the non-technical hydro community and developers. I will make it my priority to support the process of identifying opportunities, helping to prioritise them, and enabling progress in the right directions.”*
