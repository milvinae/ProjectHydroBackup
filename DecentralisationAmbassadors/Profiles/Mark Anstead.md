Mark’s Background:

“Currently studying to get my MBA at University of Detroit-Mercy, hail from the Metro Washington DC area, specifically Maryland. Been working for Cryptocurrency Network for about the last 6 months doing a lot of business development & marketing work for them. Been a DA with Hydro for about 3 months now doing bizdev work, and absolutely love it! Highly recommend it to anyone who is considering applying :) Outside of the crypto/blockchain world, I currently play lacrosse for UDM, and enjoy teaching myself guitar and ukulele!” — Mark Anstead

Mark’s Vision for Hydro:

“I think that basically every platform out there, as they begin to become more technologically sound, will need protection and security for users in the digital world. With Raindrop, and Snowflake live, and Ice coming soon, I’ll continue to use the connections I have within the cryptocurrency/blockchain space as well as the business world to introduce more partners to the Hydro ecosystem. I will also leverage the Cryptocurrency Network platform to give more exposure to Hydro” — Mark Anstead
