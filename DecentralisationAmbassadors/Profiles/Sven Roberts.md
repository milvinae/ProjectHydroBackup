# Sven’s Background:

_“My background is in both Marketing and Finance. I have a Masters degree in Marketing management (University of Tilburg), which provides me with a solid understanding about how to create and maintain brand value.
After graduating from Tilburg University (Marketing Management) I built up a career in Finance. During 2010 I joined Office Depot (European HQ) and became part of a very demanding multicultural environment. Feeling a need to contribute to society I left Office Depot in 2015 and joined Zuyderland (Dutch hospital) as a Project Manager. I have a strong affinity with new technology and started to invest in blockchain projects during 2014.”_

# Sven’s Vision for Hydro:

_“The DA Program makes it possible for me to contribute my marketing knowledge to Hydrogen. I am clearly not a fan of hyping a token but I do understand the power of marketing. Based on a well designed marketing plan I envision Hydrogen to become a well known and respected brand within the blockchain space.” _
