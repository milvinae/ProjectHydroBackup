# Jason’s Background:

_“I am a technology, language, and philosophy-loving entrepreneur with a passion for learning. I studied Mandarin Chinese and Asian Studies at the University of Vermont (as well as at Yunnan University in China). I have experience in building companies from the ground up and the aspects that excite me most are strategic planning, the technology stack, and business development. In my most recent endeavor, I founded and led kaZING, an app-based on-demand services platform which recently moved to Austin, Texas. Working as a DA for a couple of months now, I am more excited than ever about the energy and potential of Hydro. I believe that success is achieved by creating value for others and that blockchain technology (and Hydro!) will offer a value proposition strong enough to restructure the financial markets and empower individuals.”_

# Jason’s Vision for Hydro:

_“I believe Hydro has the potential to disrupt the aged fintech space through ease-of-use, security, and its strong community of users and developers. As both Hydro and the market itself are in early stages of growth, I believe that community-building is essential. This includes the core community of developers and designers, the greater community of users and supporters, as well as potential contributors and users (So far Hydro has done an amazing job at this!) Through planning, development, and outreach, I hope to help Hydro demonstrate a continued creation of value and sustained growth on its mission to bring fintech to the masses."_
