# Jonah’s Background:

_"I have spent the last 11 years co-running a company I founded that designed and coded themes for the Joomla and WordPress CMSs._

_I came across Hydro in early 2018. I was instantly intrigued by their vision of "bridging" the old world bank systems with new Blockchain technology. This seemed like the ideal way to integrate Blockchain tech into the current Fintech world. From this point on I have followed the project and contributed where I could."_


# Jonah’s Vision for Hydro:

_"My vision as a DA is to provide value to the Hydrogen Ecosystem by the two following methods:_ 

_1. Using my 11 years of UI/UX design skills to further the project's development via UI for dApps, graphics, etc._

_2. Also introducing new developers to Hydro. The Hydro MFA Joomla plugin was created by a developer that I brought on board. Although I would love to bring on more, and may, my main focus will be UI/UX design related items during my time as a DA."_
