# Harsh’s Vision for Hydro:

*“I see Hydro being able to disrupt major products in the security realm. To do so, Hydro needs to expand their ecosystem and I believe the best way to achieve that is by standardizing HCDP project guidelines and architecting rules."*  

*“I also envision establishing a quality control funnel for any projects going forward, as well as forming methodologies which will help us in breaking a project into several short phases. I see these practices helping us in creating unified products that will be scalable, streamlined and easy to use for developers and users alike, which should increase Hydro’s already great adoption rate."*
